# This **not included** file implements a dynamics version of `_request_threads`, without
# the typical dispatch cost (by doing the branching manually through recursion).
# This functionality might become necessary if we switch to dynamic allocation of
# `worker_bits` instead of the current static one.
# Such changes usually arise because we are fighting invalidations and TTFX due to
# redefinition of static variables.
# The current static solution does not have these issues because we simply overprovision
# enough static worker bits, always bigger than the number of available threads.
